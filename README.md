# XCF: Extended/Experimental Combat Framework

## Some parts of XCF are not compatible with single-player, use a 2-player LAN server instead! (this might fix problems with other mods too)
## Do not paste XCF into the ACF folder, XCF replaces ACF in the addons folder.  Remove ACF before installing XCF.  If you install XCF, you can still play in ACF servers!

XCF is an extension to ACF which includes whatever I find interesting to add to it.

Please see the wiki and issues page for current features, planned features and usage documentation.
